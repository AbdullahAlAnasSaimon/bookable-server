"description":"As it’s based on a real-life case that has already been solved, you might think all the mystery is taken out of Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood. Fortunately, that couldn’t be more wrong, because this nonfiction novel is one of the best-selling crime stories of all time. \n\nCapote had closely followed the investigation of a quadruple murder in Kansas, and was doing a bit of inerviewing himself before the murderers were caught. As a result, his book is filled with twists and turns you would not expect — surely such vile behaviors must be works of fiction?",

"description":"Giving off vibes of Capote’s Other Voices, Other Rooms, Small’s memoir Stitches is a gothic tale made all the more frightening by the fact that it’s based on real life. \n\nYou can’t always say that a family drama will leave your jaw on the floor — but this might be the exception. This intense, I-want-to-look-away-but-can’t-stop-reading story begins",

More of a loose collection of stories than a novel united by a central narrative, the vignettes in The Martian Chronicles chart the violent conflict between colonizers and natives of the Red Planet.",
